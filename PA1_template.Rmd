## Loading and preprocessing the data
In order to process the data I downloaded the file and load the data into a dataframe `data`.
```{r}
temp <- tempfile()
urlfile <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
download.file(urlfile,temp, mode="wb")
unzip(temp)
unlink(temp)

data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
